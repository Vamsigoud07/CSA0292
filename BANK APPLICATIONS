/*2. A customer has multiple deposits and withdrawals in a month. Write a C program that:

Takes n transactions as input.
Updates the balance after each transaction.
Displays the total deposits, total withdrawals, and final balance.
Example:

Initial balance: ₹5000
Deposit ₹2000 → Balance: ₹7000
Withdraw ₹1500 → Balance: ₹5500
Final balance: ₹5500*/

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int Current_balance1,Deposit,withdraw,Final_balance;
    int intial_balance=5000;
    printf("intial balance=5000");
    printf("\nAmount you want to deposit=");
    scanf("%d",&Deposit);
    Current_balance1=intial_balance+Deposit;
    printf("Current amount in account=%d",Current_balance1);
    printf("\nAmount to withdraw from account=");
    scanf("%d",&withdraw);
    Final_balance=Current_balance1-withdraw;
    printf("Final balance in account=%d",Final_balance);
    
}
OUTPUT;
intial balance=5000
Amount you want to deposit=2000
Current amount in account=7000
Amount to withdraw from account=1500
Final balance in account=5500
